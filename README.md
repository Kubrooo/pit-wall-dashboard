## About This Project

**PitWall** is an interactive web application born from a passion for the data-driven and strategic world of Formula 1. The project aims to simulate F1 races in real-time, giving users the sensation of being on a real pit wall.

The main focuses of this project are:

* **Realistic Simulation** — Brings unpredictable race dynamics including weather, Safety Cars, DNFs (Did Not Finish), and driver errors.
* **Intuitive Data Visualization** — Displays complex telemetry data (speed, tire wear, fuel) through easy-to-read charts.
* **AI Integration** — Uses AI to automatically provide post-race strategic analysis, summarizing key insights from the race.

## Key Features

### Dashboard & Visualization

* ** Live Standings:** Real-time leaderboard of all 20 drivers, updated every lap, with time intervals and DRS status.
* ** Telemetry Charts:** Real-time graphs comparing speed, tire wear, and fuel levels between top drivers.
* ** Driver Panels:** Detailed telemetry information for monitored drivers.
* ** Race & Strategy Log:** Records of all key race events (overtakes, pit stops, incidents, and team radio messages).

###  Dynamic Simulation

* ** Driver Characteristics:** Each driver has unique stats (Pace, Consistency, Tire Management) that dynamically influence performance.
* ** Realistic Weather:** Weather conditions are fetched from the Open-Meteo API and significantly affect tire grip.
* ** DRS (Drag Reduction System):** Drivers gain a speed boost when within 1 second of the car ahead.

###  Incidents & Strategy

* ** Safety Car & VSC:** Can appear randomly or due to crashes, slowing down the race and opening strategic pit stop opportunities.
* ** DNFs & Driver Errors:** Drivers can suffer mechanical failures or make mistakes (wide runs, spins, crashes) based on their stats.

###  Highlight Feature

* ** AI Strategy Insight:** After the race, data is sent to the backend server, which requests an AI model to provide an analytical summary of performance and strategy.

##  Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no heavy frameworks)

**Backend (for AI Features):**

* Node.js / Express.js

**Third-Party APIs:**

* Open-Meteo API — for real weather data
* Replicate API — for AI analysis

## How to Run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kubrooo/pit-wall-dashboard.git
```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

```bash
cd pit-wall-dashboard
```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your favorite browser. No installation or local server required — everything runs on the client side!

> Note: The **AI Strategy Insight** feature requires a backend server to function. The server code is included in this repository.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Qualification Mode — Add a qualifying session to determine starting grid positions.
* [ ] Automated Pit Stop Strategy — AI not only analyzes but also recommends optimal pit stop timing.
* [ ] Race Result Database — Save and analyze simulation results for future insights.
